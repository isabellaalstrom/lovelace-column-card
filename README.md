# column-card

A lovelace card which contains other cards and display them as if they were not inside a card at all.

## Why?

Lovelace automatically puts your cards in nice columns, the number of which are determined by the screen width:

A known trick to get a header bar to a view is to make the view a panel, and add the header via a `vertial-stacá¸±` card. But then you lose the columns. The best you can get is a `horizontal-stack`, but that doesn't adjust to the screen width.

Enter `column-card`. A card which takes other cards and display them in columns:
